# Intelligent Multimodal Speech Analysis System for Smart Call Centers

## Overview
This project aims to develop an intelligent system that integrates multimodal speech analysis for smart call centers. The system enhances customer experience, improves service quality, and provides real-time insights by analyzing voice and non-verbal cues such as tone, pitch, speech patterns, and facial expressions (if video is available) during customer interactions.

## Features
- Audio feature extraction (tone, pitch, speech patterns)
- Video analysis for facial expressions (optional)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for speech content analysis
- Machine learning models to integrate multimodal data and provide insights
- Real-time processing capabilities

## Technologies
- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Machine Learning
- Audio and Video Processing Libraries
