# Intelligent Multimodal Speech Analysis System for Smart Call Centers

## Overview
This project aims to develop an intelligent system that integrates multimodal speech analysis for smart call centers. The system enhances customer experience, improves service quality, and provides real-time insights by analyzing voice and non-verbal cues such as tone, pitch, speech patterns, and facial expressions (if video is available) during customer interactions.

## Features
- Audio feature extraction (tone, pitch, speech patterns)
- Video analysis for facial expressions (optional)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for speech content analysis
- Machine learning models to integrate multimodal data and provide insights
- Real-time processing capabilities

## Technologies
- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Machine Learning
- Audio and Video Processing Libraries

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: Main application script
- `audio_processing.py`: Audio feature extraction module
- `video_processing.py`: Video/facial expression analysis module
- `nlp_processing.py`: NLP module for speech content
- `model.py`: Machine learning model integration
- `utils.py`: Helper functions
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## Installation
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the main application:

1. Prepare your audio and video data files.

2. Modify `main.py` to load your audio and video data by replacing the placeholders:
```python
# Example to load audio data
from utils import load_audio_file, load_video_frames

audio_data = load_audio_file('path_to_audio_file.wav')
video_data = load_video_frames('path_to_video_file.mp4')
```

3. Run the main application:
```
python main.py
```
